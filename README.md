# oVirt Ansible Roles

oVirt maintains multiple Ansible roles that can be deployed to easily configure and manage various parts of the oVirt infrustructure. Ansible roles provide a method of modularizing your Ansible code, in other words; it enables you to break up large playbooks into smaller reusable files. This enables you to have a separate role for each component of the infrustructure, and allows you to reuse and share roles with other users. For more information about roles, see [Creating Reusable Playbooks] in the Ansible Documentation.

The oVirt roles can be divided into two types of roles: Logical roles and Component roles.

## Logical Roles

Logical roles are used to group component roles, or implement specific scenarios on top of
oVirt components.

* [ovirt-cluster-upgrade]
* [ovirt-host-deploy]
* [ovirt-infra]
* [ovirt-image-template]
* [ovirt-manageiq]
* [ovirt-vm-infra]

## Component Roles

Component roles enable you to manage the lifecycle of a specific oVirt component.

The [ovirt-infra] logical role implements the following helper component roles:

 * [ovirt-aaa-jdbc]
 * [ovirt-clusters]
 * [ovirt-datacenters]
 * [ovirt-host-deploy-firewalld]
 * [ovirt-hosts]
 * [ovirt-networks]
 * [ovirt-permissions]
 * [ovirt-storages]

The [ovirt-vm-infra] role includes the following helper component role:

 * [ovirt-affinity-groups]
 
## Installing the oVirt Roles

There are multiple methods to install the Ansible roles on your Ansible server.

### Installing from a Package

__Note:__ You must have the official oVirt repository enabled. For more information see the [oVirt Deployment Options].

The Ansible roles are packaged into an RPM file that can be installed from the command line.

Run the following command:
```
# yum install ovirt-ansible-roles 
```
By default the roles will be installed to `/usr/share/ansible/roles`.

### Installing using Galaxy

Ansible provides a command line utility to install Roles directory from the Galaxy Repository. See the [Galaxy] website for more information about Galaxy.

To install the role using Galaxy, run the following from the command line:
```
# ansible-galaxy install ovirt.ovirt-ansible-roles
```
By default the roles will be installed to `/etc/ansible/roles`.
